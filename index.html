            <h3 class="perspective-title">Daddy's Thoughts</h3>
            <p class="perspective-text">Your mom was in labor for more than 24 hours with you! We were nervous wrecks! The entire hospital staff was great. We started in one big room at the hospital, and your mom kept pushing, but you weren't coming out. When they finally decided to take you out with a C-section, we were wheeled into a different room, and it was a little scary looking! Your mom was laid down on a weird table, and I sat near her head, and there was a curtain that was blocking us from seeing anything below her waist. The nurse there was really nice, and talked to us to calm us down. He asked if I wanted to see. I said "no", because I really didn't want to see any blood or anything! But, he was adamant, and he told me he would tell me the exact time to look up. As soon as they pulled you out, he said "stand up." I did, and my eyes immediately focused entirely on you. Everything else went blank, and I could only see you. I was in love completely and deeply, and always will be. It was such an incredible moment, and I'll never forget it.</p>

            <p class="perspective-text">The day you were born was the happiest day of my life. I was excited, and scared at the same time as we were driving to the hospital. (Mommy is kind of a wimp when it comes to pain!) I thought you would be delivered normally, but the cord was wrapped around your neck, and you could not come out safely. Dr. Francois decided that I would need a C-section to deliver you. As the doctors laid me down, I was so anxious! I wanted to meet my baby girl, and I wanted everything to run smoothly! Daddy was there with me, which made me feel so much better. When they took you out, I wanted to hear you cry, but heard nothing. I yelled, "Why isn't she crying? Is she ok???" The doctor said, "She is just fine, and she's beautiful!" I was so relieved! You were born, finally! I was so excited to meet you that I felt as if I was bursting with joy. Eowyn, I call you my miracle baby, because Mommy was told she could never have a baby. I thank God for you every day. I could not love someone more than I love you.</p>

Daddy must have bought a dozen copies of that movie to hand out to anyone who was going to babysit you. Of course, your first Halloween we had to dress you up as your favorite character. Your Aunt Julia made you that costume, and we spent that Halloween trick or treating at your Uncle Mark and Aunt Kathy's house.

Later in life, he followed your Dad and Aunt Julia to Arizona, where he met and married Lola. He was living in Phoenix, AZ when you were born.

The first time your Mom met your Nan was when your Mom was in middle school. Your mom was throwing m&m's and being fresh, so Nan had to take them and yell at her! Later, Nan became the vice principal of the same school. She was living in Hope, Rhode Island when you were born.",
